  "Everyone has the opportunity to win points, even if it means that player might make fewer points than other players.  Well, if you are that player, welcome to the bronze tier or free tier, because other tiers make twice or sometimes thrice as many points as you.  These points will be able to be converted into member benefits, such as discounts for purchasing merchandise, quickmatch prioritization for positions, and more coming soon.",
  "Every player with bronze tier membership can participate in joining an event, however, only two ways are available: quickmatch and suggested events in the suggested events livefeed.  Manual event entry and scheduling future events are only for silver tier or above players.  Sorry bronzies.  Still, you have the opportunity to participate in everything that another player has access to, if the quickmatch algorithm would allow it."
