All gold members may invite friends to their events, providing a way for bronzies to participate like a gold.  Manual event entry and scheduling future events are limited to just silver and gold members.  You may take priority over bronzies and silvers when selecting a position that no longer has any more available positions given the rules of the sport you are playing.  No one can take your position away.  All gold members can utilize all the matchmatching preferences available using quickmatch mode including: joining an event based upon facility and location reviews, etc.",
