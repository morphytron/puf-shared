["Points","Everyone has the opportunity to win points, even if it means that player might make fewer points than other players.  Well, if you are paying for silver membership, .  These points will be able to be converted into member benefits, discounts for purchasing merchandise, quickmatch prioritization for positions, and more coming soon.",
  "Every player with silver tier membership has the opportunity to participate in joining an event using methods available.   You may join a quickmatch, create your own event, join an existing event that you may select, and you may of course join any suggested event on the suggested events livefeed.  All silver members may invite friends to their events, providing a way for bronzies to participate like a silver.  Manual event entry and scheduling future events are only for silver tier or above players.  You may take priority over bronzies when selecting a position that no longer has any more available positions given the rules of the sport you are playing.  But be wary, golds may similarly take your position since they have highest prioritization.",
   "As a silver, you will be able to view all the reviews people have created of you.  Additionally, you will be able to view your own player statistics.  As a paying member, say goodbye to annoying ads!"]
